    <h1>Project Writeup</h1>
    <p> 1. What have you done so far? </p>

          <p>  So far we have refined our project idea, 
            now focusing on creating a visualization 
            that highlights the socio-economic vulnerabilities in Colombia.
            We are planning to create a composite of the education levels, 
            access to internet and water for 1121 municipalities in Colombia.
            We are using a mapbox, as well as geojson files for Colombia to 
            overlay the map and graphically visualize the regions. 
            We have planned to create a gradient toolbar on the side 
            that captures the composite of vulnerabilities for the specific 
            municipalities. The vulnerabilities will be based on aspects included 
            in the metadata, such as employment, water access, and internet access; 
            we plan on further developing this during the week. </p>
            
            <p> 2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why? </p>

            <p>
              The most challenging part of our project will be ensuring 
              the municipality is accurate when overlaying the geojson files
              with the mapbox. Another challenge will be defining an objective 
              formula for our composite “vulnerability index” of 4 features, 
              employment, water access, education levels, and internet access. 
              Filtering the municipalities on the map will also be challenging 
              because there's a lot of them; we are working with 1121 municipalities 
              of Columbia which can be overwhelming for the reader to look at in an 
              interactive visualization. The last big challenge we expect to face 
              is going to be animating the change in our vulnerability legend as 
              the user hovers over different municipalities.
